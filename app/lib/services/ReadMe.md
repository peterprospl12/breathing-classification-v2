# Services Overview
This directory contains service modules responsible for audio processing, breath tracking, and related functionality.

## Architecture Design
The services in this directory follow specific design patterns to ensure maintainability and separation of concerns:

##Mediator Pattern
`audio_service.dart` serves as the main and only point of communication for other app components. All interactions with audio functionality should go through this service, which coordinates between the specialized services.

## Facade Pattern
The specialized services (`audio_file_service.dart`, `audio_recording_service.dart`, `breath_tracking_service.dart`, `socket_service.dart`) operate independently and don't reference each other directly. All cooperation between these services is orchestrated exclusively through `audio_service.dart`.

## Benefits
This centralized architecture provides several advantages:

* Simplified dependency management
* Easier testing of individual components
* Clear separation of responsibilities
* Reduced coupling between specialized services
* Single point of entry for all audio-related functionality
